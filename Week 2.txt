I did not get much accomplished this week due to midterms. I have been collecting paywalled papers off the library system, but I've only started reading through them. I found some interesting ones on law enforcement applications beyond traffic cams, such as matching police sketches to archived photos and possible future applications of CCTV systems. I also collected a pile of court cases involving traffic cams, though I havent found anything particularly enlightening in them yet.
